Micro Assignment #01
Your task is to design a simple website that creates a "collage" of pictures using just HTML and CSS. The images and a starter HTML document can be downloaded here as a ZIP archive. Your finished product should look like the following image:

Here are some hints to get you started:
The size of each image is available in the HTML file as a comment
Make sure your container is big enough to hold your biggest image, and that the container is centered horizontally
Think about how you can put one image on top of another (hint: refer to today's videos on CSS positioning!)
Your images should not move when the browser is resized (i.e. the Pikachu image should stay in place in front of the background & tree and should not "slide" when the browser is resized)

When you are finished please upload a copy of this file to your i6 website using the process described in Assignment 01. Name your file micro_assignment_01.html and ensure that it is accessible from within your webdev folder. You will also want to submit a link to your work on NYU Classes under the 'Assignments' tool. Eventually you will want to include this project as a link on your homepage (also described in Assignment 01) but this isn't required for the submission of this micro assignment.
