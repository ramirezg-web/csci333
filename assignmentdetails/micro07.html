	        <h1 class="page-header">Video Lesson 07</h1>
	        
	        <p>This semester our class will be running 1x per week, online. In order to make the most of our weekly meeting, and to prevent "Zoom Fatigue", I will be teaching the class using a "flipped classroom" model.   Here's how this model will operate in our class this semester:</p>
	        
	        <ul>
		        <li>Before most classes you will be asked to watch a video lesson - the lesson for this week can be found below.</li>
		        <li>After you watch all of the videos in today's lesson you will have a small task to perform - we will refer to these as "micro assignments". These "micro" assignments are fairly straightforward and short and are directly related to the content covered in the video lesson for the week.</li>
		        <li>These "micro" assignments are due before our next class meeting. You cannot turn in a "micro" assignment late. We are setting up these assignments in this way so that everyone has a baseline level of knowledge of the topics being covered in the video lesson. This will allow us to make the most of our time together during our weekly course meeting.</li>
		        <li>During our course meeting we will cover new topics during the first half of class. During the second half of class we will focus on working on a larger programming assignment together and in small groups.</li>
	        </ul>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="./micro07_files/jj56Vaz9IIk.html" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>	        

	        <h3>Cookies vs. localStorage</h3>
	        
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="./micro07_files/sbdBXqbcaAE.html" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

			<h3>PHP Cookies</h3>

			<h3>PHP Cookies: A practical example</h3>
			
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="./micro07_files/7EdqNWeYT8U.html" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
			
			<span id="micro07"></span>
			<h3>Micro Assignment #07</h3>
			
			<p>Make a copy of the files you created for <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring21/CSCI-UA.0061-001/video_06.php#micro06">Micro Assignment #06</a> - call them "micro07.php" and "micro07_process.php"</p>
			
			<p>Create a 'data' folder to hold some textual data on the server.</p>
			
			<p>Update "micro07_process.php" to save a file on the server to keep track of the following events:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>A record of successful logins</li>
				<li>A record of unsuccessful logins</li>
				<li>A record of logins that were missing either a username or a password</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>For example, you could create a file on the server that looks like the following (each line represents an event that you are logging):</p>
			
			<pre>successful
successful
successful
unsuccessful
missing
missing
missing
successful</pre>

			<p>If the user successfully logs in you should drop a cookie on their computer to "remember" this.  If this cookie is present the user should be shown a special "you are logged in" message when visiting "micro07.php".  You should also hide the login form if this cookie is present.</p>
			
			<p>When publishing this file to the server make sure you update the 'path' to the 'data' folder!  This will be different on the server.  You can do this by logging into the server using a terminal command, navigating to the data folder and running the 'pwd' command.  Alternately you can log in using an FTP program and right-click (or command-click on a mac) on the 'data' folder to find the server path of the folder.  In addition, ensure that the 'data' folder has full permissions set on it (777).  Don't upload your data file - instead, let apache on the server create this file (if you upload your own file you will also need to set its permissions to 777 on the server as well)</p>
			
				
			<p>When you are finished please upload a copy of this file to your i6 website using the process described in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring21/CSCI-UA.0061-001/assignment01.php">Assignment 01</a>.  Name your file <code>micro07.php</code> and ensure that it is accessible from within your <code>webdev</code> folder.  You will also want to submit a link to your work on <a href="https://newclasses.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU Classes</a> under the 'Assignments' tool.  You will want to include this project as a link on your homepage (also described in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring21/CSCI-UA.0061-001/assignment01.php">Assignment 01</a>)</p>
