Micro Assignments & Participation
This semester our class will be running 1x per week, online. In order to make the most of our weekly meeting, and to prevent "Zoom Fatigue", I will be running this class using a "flipped classroom" model. Here's how this model will work for our class this semester:

Before most classes you will be asked to watch a video lesson. The topics covered in these video lessons can be found on the "Schedule" page on the sidebar of our class website.
Each video lesson will have a small task for you to perform - we will refer to these as "micro assignments". These "micro" assignments will be fairly straightforward and short, but they are due before our next class meeting. You cannot turn in a "micro" assignment late. We are setting up these assignments in this way so that everyone has a baseline level of knowledge of the topics being covered in the video lesson. This will allow us to make the most of our time together during our weekly course meeting.
During our course meeting we will cover new topics during the first half of class. During the second half of class we will focus on working on a larger programming assignment together and in small groups. These larger programming assignments will become your "macro" assignments (described below)
Macro Assignments
There will be 9 "macro" assignments in this course that will be assigned on a weekly basis. I use the word "macro" to differentiate these between the smaller "micro" assignments described above. In general, "macro" assignments are due about 2 weeks after they are assigned at 11:55pm EDT (just before midnight). For a full outline of assignment due dates please refer to the “Schedule” link to the left.

All assignments will be submitted via your digital portfolio site and NYU Classes. We will discuss how you can set up this site on the first day of class.

It is important not to get behind in turning your assignments (this class is cumulative). Late submissions will be penalized by 10% off per day late, and assignments that are more than 7 days late can not be turned in for credit. That being said, sometimes there are unforeseen situations that may impede your progress, as a result you are being given 7 grace days for the entire semester. These grace days cover all late submissions regardless of personal, professional, or technical related delays (e.g. a job interview, computer hardware failure, etc.) and no further exceptions will be granted (so don't waste them simply by procrastinating). You don't need to do anything special to use these "grace" days - the course graders will keep track of these on your behalf and will apply them to your work as necessary.

All grading will be done via NYU’s official course management system (NYU Classes). You can check your grades at any time by logging into your NYU Home page (http://home.nyu.edu) and clicking through to the NYU Classes section established for our class. If you notice an irregularity (i.e. you mistakenly lost points for an item that you successfully completed) please let me know and I will be happy to sit down with you to review your work. All grade changes must be completed in person and cannot be done over e-mail.

Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It is fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask your fellow students to actually do the work for you. When you turn in an assignment, you are saying that you have done this work yourself. The definition of plagiarism is to present someone else’s work as though it were your own. Please read the Computer Science Department statement on academic integrity for more information.

Portfolio
During this class you will be maintaining a digital portfolio that will showcase your work and serve as a documentation repository for all of your projects. In the spirit of "openness" a link to your portfolio will be made available on the "Portfolio" page of our class website. I encourage you to check out the projects that your fellow students are working on and use their ideas as inspiration in your own work! However, if you wish to not be included in this directory please let me know and I will be happy to remove you from the page.

i6 Accounts
If you do not already have one, you will be assigned a Unix Web server account at the start of the semester. This is called an “i6” account and we will use it to host our websites. All class work should be posted here. You are welcome to post projects elsewhere (i.e. your own domain) during the semester but be sure to also publish them to i6. Common questions about i6 accounts are answered on this FAQ page. If you forget your i6 password and would like to reset it, go to this page for instructions on how to do so.

Home Computers
Many students will have access to home computers or computers at work. It is fine to do your assignments on whatever resources you have available, as long as your software is current. You are more than welcome to bring your computer to class and follow along, but please stay focused (i.e. browsing Facebook in class is frowned upon)

Feedback
I recognize that every student has a different level of background knowledge prior experience when it comes to technology. This course is designed as an introductory level class and topics will be presented assuming very little prior exposure to the topics. With that said, every student learns differently and I want to ensure that each of you is getting the maximum amount out of the course content as possible. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via e-mail or during office hours if you feel as though you are Springing behind or you are not understanding a certain concept.
